# 🧩 Custom .deb Repository for Debian & Ubuntu

The **Custom .deb Repository** is a self-hosted APT-compatible repository designed primarily for distributing `.deb` packages on **Debian** and **Ubuntu** systems.  
While the repository name references `.deb` files, it can also include other related resources such as shell scripts, configuration files, documentation, or archives used alongside the packages.

---

## 📖 Overview
This repository acts like a standard Debian or Ubuntu mirror but is focused on **custom and experimental software** rather than official packages.  
It provides a simple, accessible way to host personal or organizational software for easy installation and updates through the APT package manager.

Although most content consists of `.deb` packages, other files may be stored for deployment, installation, or development support.  
All hosted content follows the Debian-style directory structure to maintain compatibility with APT.
