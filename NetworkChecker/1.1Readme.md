# ðŸ§© NetworkChecker 1.1

NetworkChecker 1.1 is a self-contained network interface monitoring tool for Debian and Ubuntu systems. It continuously monitors a specified network interface and alerts when the interface goes up or down, with enhanced automation and setup features.

Key Features

Automatic interface selection: Prompts the user on first run to choose the network interface and saves the choice for future sessions.

Self-installing: Creates its own folder in /usr/local/bin/NetworkChecker and copies itself there automatically.

Automatic file type & permissions: Ensures it is recognized as an executable shell script and sets correct permissions automatically.

Autostart at boot: Creates a systemd service so the monitoring script runs automatically on system startup.

Real-time alerts: Provides colored terminal messages for interface status changes.

Persistent configuration: Remembers the chosen interface across reboots.

Lightweight and easy to deploy: No additional dependencies beyond standard Linux utilities.

Typical Use Cases

Monitor critical network interfaces on servers or workstations.

Alert administrators immediately when a network goes down.

Automatically deploy across multiple systems without manual setup.

Installation: Can be installed manually or packaged as a .deb for easy deployment via a custom APT repository.
